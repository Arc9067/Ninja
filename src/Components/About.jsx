            The Sengoku period (1477 - 1573) marked a turning point in the
            history of Japan. During this period of wars and internal strife,
            the power of the shoguns was weakened and passed into the hands of
            the local lords. It is also a period of cultural evolution: Zen
            influences culture and Westerners arrive.
